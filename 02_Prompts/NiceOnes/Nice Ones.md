# Request for Assistance: Migrating Dataclasses to Pydantic Models

Hello ChatGPT,

I have an important task I need your assistance with, and I hope you can help guide me through it effectively.

I have attached the following files for your review:

- **`pid_schema.py`** – Contains the new Pydantic models.
- **`pid_model.py`** – Includes the original dataclass definitions.
- **`convert_pid_to_ui`** – Contains an earlier implementation of the conversion logic.
- **`DTO_Mapping_Example.txt`** – Provides an example of how the DTO (Data Transfer Object) mapping should be structured.

## Objective

### 1. **Enhance the `pid_schema` Models with Conversion Capability**

- **Goal:** Introduce a `from_dataclass` class method to selected Pydantic models in the `pid_schema.py` file.
- **Functionality:** This method should convert instances of the legacy `dataclass` structures (defined in `pid_model.py`) into the corresponding Pydantic models.
- **Purpose:** This migration step is part of a broader effort to transition our schema definition from traditional Python `dataclasses` to Pydantic v2 models, which offer better integration with modern tooling and validation features.

The `DTO_Mapping_Example.txt` provides a concrete example of how the transformation should be implemented using a DTO-style approach.

Previously, I employed a standalone `convert_pid_to_ui` function for this purpose. However, I now aim to encapsulate this logic within each Pydantic class as a class method for improved modularity and clarity.

Thank you in advance for your support and insight!
