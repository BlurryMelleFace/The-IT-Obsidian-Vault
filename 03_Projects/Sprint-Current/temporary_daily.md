Daily: 

So yesterday I spent my day working on the next steps I discussed with anita and razvan. 

We discussed that we would consolidate all prior recognition, image processing functions into one file_processing task. This currently means redlining and convertPDF to png, as of my knowledge.

This is where I would ask any of you guys - if there are other functions we should outsource into this task please let me know. 

Now that this is done I worked on syncing the task status with our DynamoDB database. this is implemented so instead of the current 4 there are 5 tasks - we should also discuss if we want the file_processing task to show up in the UI like the other as it does take a considerable amout of time sometimes. 

Today I will try and clean up my current code so I can start with writing tests next week
