Yesterday: 

1. As I mentioned I had some redis Problems I ran into yesterday. Kindly Razvan helped me out here and we both figured out that the Docker hub regestry was down. That later got resolved so my local Setup worked again. 
2. Iâ€™ve successfully configured the connection to the database Locally and also the connection to the Pune Database.

Today: 

1. I am reading into SQLAlchemy which we are using to query the database and also get familiar witht the database code.
