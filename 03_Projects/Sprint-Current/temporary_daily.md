All tasks are done for the sprint. Except for the bug concerning the redis master and replica retry. I still need to figure out how to recreate a redis overload in AWS. I got changes implemented on my branch which i would no need to test. 

Apart from that I chatted with razvan yesterday and the sonarcube checks on the api still did not pass even though the high issues werse solved by razvan. 

so I helped out there and fixed some medium an low sonarcube issues. now the tecnical dept is under a specific threshold so Now we are passing the quality gate for the api.
