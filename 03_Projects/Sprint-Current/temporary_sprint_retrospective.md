# üöÄ Sprint Retrospective ‚Äì Sprint 9 (Weeks 25-14 to 25-16)

## ‚úÖ What Went Well

- **Significant Progress on AG Grid Integration**
  - Implemented dynamic AG Grid components with full support for filtering, column flexing, dropdown tooltips, and floating filters.
  - Split architecture between base and parent grid components to ensure modularity.
  - Added functionality like selection handlers and interaction hooks with the canvas.

- **Successful Spike Completion**
  - Finished the AG Grid spike and moved to implementation phase.
  - Validated the feasibility and integration of Siemens IX components into the UI.

- **Bugfixes and Improvements**
  - Resolved zoom/pan issue when adding a new row.
  - Contributed to UX clarification and interaction design following Prajacta‚Äôs input.

- **Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration**
  - Helped teammates (Luke, Farheen, Pulkit) with issues.
  - Held meetings with Paul and Pulkit to align on UI direction and component usage.

- **Personal Development & Wins**
  - Passed the theory test for driver‚Äôs license (üéâ).
  - Continued practical motorbike training successfully.
  - Maintained motivation and clear vision (trip to France with surf & survival gear).

## üß± What Could Be Improved

- **Unclear Task Ownership Early in Sprint**
  - Multiple entries show confusion or idleness due to a lack of clear tasks or planning, especially post-vacation.

- **Blocked by Dependencies**
  - Progress was hindered by unfinished UX designs and pending refactors (e.g. Paul‚Äôs major refactor).

- **Context Switching**
  - Time was fragmented due to personal tasks (doctor visits, practical lessons, etc.), leading to variable productivity.

- **Canvas and AG Grid Coupling**
  - Current canvas-AG Grid interactions are fragile. Canvas disarrangement on AG Grid edits needs rethinking.

## üõ†Ô∏è Action Points for Next Sprint

1. **Improve Task Clarity**
   - Ensure everyone has assigned and well-understood tasks after sprint planning, especially after returning from breaks.

2. **Introduce Weekly Syncs**
   - Add short weekly workflow or correction meetings to align and adapt quickly as blockers arise.

3. **Strengthen AG Grid ‚Üî Canvas Integration**
   - Define a stable API or interface for communication between grid and canvas to avoid side effects like view resets.

4. **UX/UI Alignment**
   - Collaborate closely with UX to finalize wireframes before UI implementation begins.

5. **Buffer Time for Personal Priorities**
   - Proactively communicate upcoming personal obligations to plan workload realistically.

## üéØ Overall Sprint Summary

Despite some start-of-sprint uncertainty and external distractions, the sprint saw **major technical progress**, particularly with AG Grid and UI architecture. There‚Äôs a clear direction emerging, and a stronger structure for task management and team alignment will make the next sprint even more effective.
