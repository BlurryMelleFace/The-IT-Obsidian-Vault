# Conversion Script Assistance Request

## Overview

Hello ChatGPT,

Today, I require your assistance with a critical task involving the implementation of a conversion script. The script is intended to transform a PID object into one of my Pydantic models, specifically the `SymbolTextPayload`, which is used on the frontend of my application.

## Files Provided

I have attached four files for your reference:

1. **models.txt**  
    This file contains all the Pydantic models used as data classes to facilitate the transfer of data to the frontend.
    
2. **pid_object.txt**  
    This is a sample PID object. It represents the input that will be passed to the conversion script for processing into the corresponding Pydantic models.
    
3. **pid_to_ui_conversion.txt**  
    This Python script is the core of the task. It is responsible for performing the actual conversion. This is where your implementation expertise is needed.
    
4. **pid_model.txt**  
    This file outlines the structure of the PID data. It defines the format and organization of the PID object that will be converted.
    

## Context

Both the PID model and the Pydantic models are properly imported into the conversion script, so all necessary components are available. Your task is to assist me in implementing a clean, effective, and maintainable conversion logic within the `pid_to_ui_conversion.txt` script.

## Expectations

- The conversion logic should be robust, clear, and efficient.
    
- The final implementation should adhere to best practices in Python development.
    
- Please prioritize readability, maintainability, and performance.
    

I am looking forward to your guidance and collaboration on this important task. Thank you very much in advance for your support!
