# Request for Canvas Integration Advice in Angular Application

Hello ChatGPT,

I need your assistance with a critical and time-sensitive issue concerning an Angular application I'm currently developing. I’ve attached a file containing the relevant code for your review.

### Context

The application includes a **Canvas Page** featuring a split-screen layout:

- **Left Panel:** A canvas that displays a P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram) image with overlaid bounding boxes.
- **Right Panel:** An AG Grid table showing metadata for each detected item (e.g., symbols) overlaid on the image.

### Background

The canvas implementation is outdated and highly rigid, limiting current functionality and future extensibility. We previously used Angular Material Table (MatTable), which introduced numerous limitations. We've since migrated to **AG Grid**, which offers improved flexibility and performance.

Now, the challenge is to **integrate AG Grid with a more modern and maintainable canvas solution** that supports the following:

### Requirements

1. Display static images (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
2. Overlay bounding boxes based on metadata from AG Grid rows.
3. Future capability to draw lines between items.
4. Basic built-in interaction features:
    - Panning
    - Zooming
    - Selection
5. Ease of integration into an Angular application.
6. Avoids the need to manually implement navigation buttons and interaction handling from scratch.

### Request

Can you recommend a modern canvas or graphics library that satisfies the above requirements and is well-suited for integration into an Angular project? Additionally, after reviewing the attached code, I’d appreciate guidance on how to replace the legacy canvas with the new solution.

Thank you for your expert support.
