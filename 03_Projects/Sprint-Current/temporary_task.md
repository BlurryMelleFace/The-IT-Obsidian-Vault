# Refined Prompt

I have attached our current **UI code** for review, specifically in the context of its integration with the Siemens Analytics service.

Here is the current setup and my request:

1. **Context**:  
   - The project is built with Angular.  
   - We are attempting to integrate Siemens Analytics into the application.  
   - I have already made an attempt to connect to the service.  

2. **Environment Variables**:  
   - We maintain separate environment configurations, including **development (`dev`)** and **template-based variables**.  

3. **Initialization**:  
   - Before Angular code compilation and application startup, there is an initialization step where I attempt to set up the Siemens Analytics service.  
   - This initialization logic occurs in the **app initialization phase**.  

4. **Code Components**:  
   - A dedicated file, **`analytic-service.ts`**, is included in the project.  
   - This file contains the logic for handling analytics integration.  

5. **Request**:  
   - Please review how the Siemens Analytics integration is currently set up.  
   - Explain in detail how the system works at the moment.  
   - Provide clear recommendations for the **next steps** required to ensure a proper and stable integration.

---

**Goal**: I want a clear understanding of the current Siemens Analytics implementation, along with practical guidance on what actions should be taken next to complete or improve the integration.
