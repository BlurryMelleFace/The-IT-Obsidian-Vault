# Request for Code Refactoring Assistance

Hello ChatGPT,

I've attached a `run.py` file containing several backend endpoints currently used in my application. One of these endpoints is already designed to return a Pydantic model via the `response_model` parameter, which I understand is a safer and more structured approach than returning plain `JSONResponse` objects. Please feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken.

Here is an example of such an endpoint, located in the `# ConversionUtility` section:

```python
@app.post(
    "/convertPidToUi/{file_name}",
    response_model=Union[SymbolTextPayload, ConnectionTextPayload],
    tags=["Conversion Utility"],
)
async def convert_pid_to_ui(request: Request, file_name: str, payload_selection: PayloadSelectionEnum = Query(...)):
    json_data = await process_request(
        request, "POST", f"{url}/convertPidToUi/{file_name}?payload_selection={payload_selection.value}"
    )

    if payload_selection == PayloadSelectionEnum.symbol_text_payload:
        return SymbolTextPayload(**json_data)
    else:
        return ConnectionTextPayload(**json_data)
```

I would like your assistance in updating the remaining endpoints in the file to follow a similar structure. Specifically, please replace all instances of `JSONResponse` with appropriate `response_model` specifications using hypothetical Pydantic classes (you may create placeholder models for now; I will define the actual structures later).

Your refactored suggestions should ensure that all endpoints are consistent, robust, and aligned with FastAPI best practices.

Thank you in advance for your help!
