# Task Description for ChatGPT

## Overview

Hello ChatGPT,  
Today marks a new beginning, and I'm reaching out with a task that has been persistently troubling me. I would greatly appreciate your assistance in resolving it.

## Problem Statement

Whenever I add a new row to the data structure in my application, the canvas displaying the P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram) image automatically shifts its focus to the top-left corner of the image.

### Current Behavior:
- Adding a new row causes the view to jump to the top-left corner of the P&ID canvas.

### Expected Behavior:
- The current view and focus area of the P&ID canvas should remain unchanged when a new row is added. In other words, the canvas should not scroll or move; it should preserve its current zoom and scroll position.

## Request

Please review the code I have appended and help me resolve this issue. The goal is to maintain the canvas's visual state (i.e., position and zoom level) when new data rows are introduced.

Thank you in advance for your support!
