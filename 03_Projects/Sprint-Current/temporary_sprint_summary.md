# üèÅ Sprint Review Summary

## üìå Key Tasks Completed

- **IPID Deployment & Environment Setup**
  - Deployed a stable version of the IPID product in the cloud.
  - Prepared the environment for the Sprint Review demo.
  - Supported the UI demo team (e.g., symbol classification file for UI).

- **Backend Development & API Work**
  - **Schema Conversion Logic:**
    - Developed robust mapping between legacy `dataclass` models and new `Pydantic` models (`PIDSchema` ‚Üî `PIDModel`).
    - Preserved critical metadata fields (e.g., `image_size`, `path`) to ensure data integrity.
    - Introduced `from_dataclass()` and `from_pid_model()` class methods.
  - **API Refactoring:**
    - Separated exception handling into a `utilities/error_handling.py` module.
    - Cleaned up and finalized API endpoints in both the **Core API** and the **BFF**.
    - Implemented logic for symbol-text associations and backend state handling.

- **Testing & Stability**
  - Wrote and finalized unit tests to cover new schema and save functionalities.
  - Validated API compatibility with frontend (incl. file save and load operations).
  - Refined and tested all logic before final merges.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Achievements

- **Successful Migration:**
  - Full migration to Pydantic v2-based schemas.
  - Created a clean separation between internal logic models and frontend-compatible schemas.
  
- **Feature Deliverables:**
  - Save functionality for symbol-text associations.
  - Refined endpoints with proper descriptions, error returns, and metadata handling.
  - Cleaned up and merged critical branches in BFF and Core API.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Resolutions

- **Circular Imports & Metadata Loss:**
  - Handled circular import issues using `TYPE_CHECKING` and string-based annotations.
  - Addressed metadata field loss by redesigning schema fields without overcomplicating the PID model.

- **High Pressure & Uncertainty:**
  - Managed significant pressure due to high responsibility on backend logic.
  - Maintained momentum by focusing on clarity, iterative implementation, and team syncs.

## üéØ Overall Sprint Outcome

- Backend foundation for schema mapping and data handling is **fully implemented and tested**.
- All major branches are **merged and stable**.
- Team is now equipped to expand on top of this structure for future UI and API integration tasks.
- Strong coordination with Anita and Michael ensured alignm
