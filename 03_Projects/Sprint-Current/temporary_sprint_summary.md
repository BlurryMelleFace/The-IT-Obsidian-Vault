# Sprint 10 Review Summary

## ðŸ”§ Key Tasks Completed

- **Data Structure Refactoring**
  - Transformed the backend data structure from a flat to a normalized model for improved clarity and scalability.
  - Fully integrated the new structure into the Pydantic models and the API/BFF.
  - Created a dual-phase approach (symbol-text and connection-text associations) to better serve the UI requirements.

- **AG Grid Implementation (Frontend Table Refactor)**
  - Successfully implemented AG Grid into the Angular UI, replacing the legacy MatTable.
  - Hooked up bidirectional interaction between grid rows and the canvas (e.g., selecting a row highlights a bounding box).
  - Integrated action buttons (Accept/Reject) into each row, with reactive status logic.

- **API & BFF Enhancements**
  - Refactored API endpoints to align with the updated data models and improved error handling.
  - Used OpenAPI TypeScript tooling to generate consistent front-end types (`openapi-typescript`), reducing duplication and mismatches.
  - Implemented Symbol and Connection Catalog APIs to deliver necessary metadata to the frontend.

- **UX and UI Discussions**
  - Held several team meetings to align on the new UI data structure and save functionality.
  - Prepared and reviewed detailed proposals for how data should flow through the system under the new architecture.

## ðŸš§ Challenges & Solutions

- **Legacy Canvas Integration**
  - Challenge: The existing canvas component was tightly coupled with the old data structure, making integration with the new AG Grid complex and unstable.
  - Solution: Proposed a complete overhaul or replacement of the canvas to decouple it from outdated structures; ongoing discussions with team.

- **Coordination with Concurrent Refactoring (Paulâ€™s Work)**
  - Challenge: Simultaneous grid and UI refactoring efforts led to confusion and potential code conflicts.
  - Solution: Focused on maintaining API contract compatibility and planning a full merge once Paulâ€™s changes are stabilized.

- **Emotional Distraction**
  - Acknowledged personal distractions and stress but remained committed to delivery, using work and structure as an outlet to regain focus.

## âœ… Notable Achievements

- Functional AG Grid integrated into the app with interactive row actions and dynamic styling.
- Backend and frontend now operate with a shared, consistent data model, reducing technical debt.
- Symbol and connection data now seamlessly passed through the system and visualized in the UI.
- Established groundwork for future enhancements, including save functionality and full AG Grid transition (e.g., A42 Grid adoption).

## ðŸ“Œ Summary for Presentation

This sprint focused on **migrating from a legacy table and data model to a scalable, UI-friendly architecture**. The core achievements were the successful **integration of AG Grid**, the **refactoring of the data flow (backend to frontend)**, and the **first functional steps toward an interactive, maintainable P&ID viewer**. Despite technical and emotional challenges, key progress was made across the stack, paving the way for a cleaner and more robust implementation in upcoming sprints.
