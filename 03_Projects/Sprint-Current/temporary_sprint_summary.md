# Sprint 16 – Review Summary

## Key Work Areas

### 1. API Refactoring & Improvements
- Refactored the entire API structure to align with **FastAPI best practices**:
  - Split `run.py` into modular structure with `api/` and `core/` folders.
  - Introduced **routers**, **typed dependencies**, and **dependency injection**.
  - Implemented **domain errors** and centralized **exception handlers**.
  - Added **docstrings** for SonarQube compliance.
- Restructured Celery task logic:
  - Improved task configuration.
  - Explored **Chords and Chains** for better task orchestration.
- Testing:
  - Fixed and adapted tests after refactor.
  - Increased coverage to **~75%**, meeting SonarQube requirements.

### 2. Logging & Analytics (Frontend Integration)
- Integrated **Siemens Analytics service (Matomo-based)** into the frontend.
- Achievements:
  - Logging of **route changes** between UI pages.
  - Added **user identification** (from local storage with fallbacks).
  - Set up workflow/context-based logging for different UI components.
  - Established a **dashboard** to visualize logged events.
- Next Steps discussed:
  - Support environment variables & session storage for identifiers.
  - Expand logging to button clicks and contextual actions.

### 3. Collaboration & Team Contributions
- Authored **meeting minutes (MoM)** and shared outcomes with the team.
- Helped colleagues with test configuration issues (e.g., Poetry setup).
- Coordinated with Anita and Rahul on API and logging tasks.
- Engaged in refinement discussions about **security topics** and **UI bug fixes**.

## Challenges
- **Large-scale refactor** touched many files, making the merge request difficult to review.  
  → Acknowledged in communication, committed to splitting future changes into smaller steps.
- Encountered difficulties with **Celery tasks** integration and Redis connections.  
  → Iterated solutions and explored advanced Celery features.
- Needed to adjust **tests** significantly due to refactor.  
  → Solved by updating coverage configuration and fixing failing cases.

## Achievements & Deliverables
- **Clean, modular API architecture** ready for long-term maintainability.
- **Exception handling & domain error framework** implemented.
- **Celery tasks refactored** and improved with future scalability in mind.
- **75%+ test coverage** achieved (from ~30% failing previously).
- **Frontend logging service operational**, with route tracking and user identification integrated.
- **Analytics dashboard** up and running for monitoring user interactions.

✅ **Overall Outcome**:  
This sprint delivered a **robust API refactor**, introduced **structured error handling**, boosted **test coverage**, and successfully **integrated frontend logging** with analytics. These improvements significantly enhance maintainability, observability, and readiness for upcoming features.
