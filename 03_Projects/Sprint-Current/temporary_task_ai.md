okay so there is one more thing. I need your help with - currently when the user wants to add a new symbol or a new text/ connection it is quite weird he does not know what to do or Where he should navigate to so it is quite hard for the user to really understand where his mouth mouth should be and sometimes leads to confusions so you can leave the application then not draw a text not jaw symbol and this is quite confusing so what I was wanting to ask you is when we press this ad button for example in the adding text on the detail view is there a way for us to like gray out everything except the canvas so the user knows he has to work with the canvas or maybe even make the user only be able to navigate all the canvas on the image basically and when while he clicked this while he toggled the adding button so is that something you could implement please help me here
