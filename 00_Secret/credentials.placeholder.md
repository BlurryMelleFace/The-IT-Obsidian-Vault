**ðŸ”’ Placeholder File**

This file is a placeholder.  
Your real credentials should be stored in `credentials.local.md`, which is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

To use this setup:
1. Duplicate this file.
2. Rename the copy to `credentials.local`.
3. Store your sensitive data in the new file â€” it will **not** be tracked by Git.

Your `credentials.local.md` might look like this:

```yaml
GIT_USERNAME:: your-username
GIT_TOKEN:: your-token
```
